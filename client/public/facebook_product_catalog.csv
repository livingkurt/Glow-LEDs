Diffuser Caps put patterns and designs on the outside of your glove to add a one-of-a kind effect to your lightshows using an exclusive screw top technology!
The Diffuser Adapters serve a dual purpose of being the anchor for the caps, as well as diffusing your light with a beautiful frosted effect.
To use Diffuser Caps, you need a set of Diffuser Adapters. Simply place the Diffuser Adapters on your microlight inside the glove and then twist on the Cap from the outside of the glove. Simple as that! Click on the Manual tab above if you have any questions or issues.
If you haven’t bought Diffuser Caps before, we recommend purchasing the Diffuser Caps + Adapters Starter Kit to ensure you’ll have everything you need.
You only need to buy Diffuser Adapters once! They are always compatible with any Diffuser Caps set. 
Each Diffuser Caps set is available in 2 sizes: Classic and Mega. Expect Classic to be around the size of a typical diffuser, while Mega is there if you really want to up the ante. 
Diffuser Caps fit any microlight! For a complete experience, we recommend pairing them with a set of OPYN Glowskinz.
